This directory has been repurposed for text logs, possibly modelled on 
syslogd.  The following projects appear promising:

http://syslog-win32.sourceforge.net/ (server & client library) 
and 
http://ntsyslog.sourceforge.net/ (server only)

This article discusses one and lists others: http://troy.jdmz.net/syslogwin/.
