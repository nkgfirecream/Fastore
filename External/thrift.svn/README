Status
======

Patches allow Fastore to compile without warnings on VS2012. 

To generate patches in Windows, use "add-patch.pl -x".  Without the -x it only 
displays the patch status.  

To apply patches in Linux, use "make repatch".  Note this starts by
reverting any changes in the thrift working directory, because patches
are generated against the repository. 

There is no script yet to automate applying patches in Windows. 

N.B. When using "svn update", take care *not* to update the trunk directory
explicitly.  Update thrift.svn only; the svn:external property will bring 
thrift to a specific revision.  If you update trunk, you will bring it 
to the current revision.  (This is just a function of how Subversion works.) 

Required Software
=================

Perl can be installed from ActiveState. 

Scripted patch application can be effected if "patch" is installed from the 
GNU Win32 project. http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html. 

Build Preconditions
===================

1.  Define THIRD_PARTY=%CD%\..\boost_1_51_0 environment variable
2.  Copy libthrift.vcxproj to trunk\lib\cpp or use the infomation in 
    that file to update yours.  Changes are a

    a.  reference to THIRD_PARTY
    b.  define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
